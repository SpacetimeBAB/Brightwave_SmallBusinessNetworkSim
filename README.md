# Brightwave_SmallBusinessNetworkSim
A simple small business network simulation meant to work on my networking skills via Cisco Packet Tracer. January 2026

# Purpose
Aims to make a simple network for the small business fictional company Brightwave, in which they have 25 employees and I must provide connectivity, DHCP, static IPs for server and printer, and basic security.

# Features
-Connects 25 PCs to the network
-All pcs can access the printer and server on the network
-2 Switches to prevent overload
-4 VLANs for each department for added organization.
-VLANs add layers of security so each department is kept separated and not all departments can be breached.

# Testing
Passes all ping tests and all PCs can connect to the printer and server. 
IT can ping all departments however when departments like Staff ping IT, it is refused.
